## Problem Statement

#### Explanation
The internet has an ocean of data that is free and available to everyone. These data, scattered over the internet, when collected and properly analysed can give a lot of insight to solve real-world problems. They can also help police to make better-informed decisions. OSINT or Open-Source Intelligence
involves collecting data from public and open sources for intelligence purposes. Data could be in the form of audio, video, image, text, etc., and may be available from sources such as social media sites, public-facing servers, articles, newsletters, online discussion groups, blogs, and code repositories.

#### Expected Outcomes
- To create a solution to fetch the complete information about a person when a username, e-mail address, phone number, or any unique identifier is provided as the input.
- This information can be gathered from all available sources on the internet including the dark web. The data so gathered should be analyzed and correlated to predict possible future threats. In this, you can also include facial recognition and social media matching capabilities to derive meaningful insights.
- Alerting and ticketing capabilities should also be integrated into this.
